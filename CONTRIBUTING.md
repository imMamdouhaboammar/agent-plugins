# Contributing to agent-plugins

Thanks for helping improve these agent plugins. This repo is a multi-plugin
marketplace; read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the architecture, content
standards, and the per-plugin release model before contributing.

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Make changes following the guidelines below.
4. Test your changes (see Testing).
5. Open a pull request (the template is enforced).

## When to Contribute

**Good contributions:**

- ✅ New plugins that are useful, self-contained skills
- ✅ New best practices with community consensus
- ✅ Corrections to outdated or incorrect information
- ✅ Sharper organization, better examples, clearer structure
- ✅ Version-specific updates for tools a plugin targets

**Not suitable:**

- ❌ Personal preferences without community consensus
- ❌ Untested content changes (show baseline -> improved evidence)
- ❌ Content that merely duplicates existing agent knowledge
- ❌ Hand-edited version numbers (CI owns them)

## Adding a Plugin

**External** (content + releases in its own repo) — manifest entry only:

1. Add a `plugins[]` entry to ALL THREE manifests:
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
   (`source: { "source": "github", "repo": "owner/repo", "ref": "vX.Y.Z" }`
   plus a mirrored top-level `version: "X.Y.Z"`),
   `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (Codex), and
   `.kiro/plugins/marketplace.json` (Kiro mirror) — same `name`/`ref`, no
   `version` in the latter two.
2. No local content, CHANGELOG, tests, or scoped-commit release.
3. **Do not hand-bump the pin.** The scheduled `Update External Plugins`
   workflow (`.github/workflows/update-external-plugins.yml`) auto-discovers
   every external entry, resolves the latest upstream release, and opens a
   reviewable `chore(external-plugins): ...` PR that updates `source.ref` in
   all three manifests and the mirrored `version`. The updater refuses an
   automatic downgrade if the pinned release is newer than the latest eligible
   upstream release. Override defaults (prereleases, tag pattern,
   tags-vs-releases) per plugin in `.github/external-plugin-updates.json`. CI
   cross-checks the three manifests stay in sync and rejects stale external
   entries left behind in either mirror.

**Inline** (content lives here):

1. `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<plugin>/SKILL.md` with valid frontmatter
   (`name`, `description`; optional `metadata.version`).
2. Add a `plugins[]` entry: `name`, `source: ./plugins/<plugin>`,
   `description`, `version` (`0.1.0`), optional `category` / `keywords`.
3. `plugins/<plugin>/CHANGELOG.md` (may be empty; CI prepends to it).
4. The manifest `version` must equal the SKILL.md `metadata.version` (and the
   `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` `version`, if the plugin ships one). CI
   enforces this.
5. `plugins/<plugin>/tests/baseline-scenarios.md` is **required** and
   CI-enforced (see Testing). It must contain at least one `## Scenario ...`,
   a `## Running These Tests` protocol, and a `### Success Criteria` list.
6. Kiro Power (optional): with a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` present, run
   `python3 .github/scripts/build_power.py plugins/<plugin>` and commit the
   generated `plugins/<plugin>/POWER.md`. It is CI-owned — never hand-edit;
   the release pipeline regenerates it and `validate.yml` `--check`s it.

See CLAUDE.md "SKILL.md Architecture" and the "LLM Consumption Rules" for
content shape and token discipline.

## Commits & Releases

Releases are automated and **per-plugin, for inline plugins only**. A commit
qualifies for a plugin when it changes release-worthy content under
`plugins/<plugin>/` (anything except `tests/` and the CI-managed
`CHANGELOG.md`), or when its subject is scoped to that plugin
(`feat(<plugin>): ...`, back-compat). The commit **type** sets the bump.
External plugins release upstream; their pins are bumped automatically by the
`Update External Plugins` workflow (a reviewable `chore(external-plugins): ...`
PR), not by hand.

| Qualifying commit type | Result |
|------------------------|--------|
| `feat: ...` (or scoped) | minor bump |
| `fix:` / `perf:` / `refactor:` (or scoped) | patch bump |
| `<type>!:` / `<type>(<plugin>)!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` / `BREAKING-CHANGE:` footer | major bump |
| `chore`/`docs`/`ci`/`test`, or no conventional type | no release |
| touches only `tests/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or no plugin content | no release |

PRs are squash-merged, so the squash subject's type plus the changed paths
drive the release; set the subject type deliberately. A squash touching two
plugins bumps both.

## Testing

Tests are **required**, not optional. Plugin content is executable
documentation, so its behavior is tested with regression scenarios against a
real agent host. Repository automation under `.github/scripts/` also has
stdlib unit tests run by `validate.yml`.

**Every inline plugin must ship `plugins/<plugin>/tests/baseline-scenarios.md`**
with this structure (CI fails the PR if it is missing or incomplete):

```text
# Baseline Scenarios
<intro: compare WITHOUT vs WITH the skill>

## Running These Tests
<the WITHOUT -> WITH -> compare -> gate protocol>

## Scenario 1: <name>
### Test Prompt
### Expected Baseline Behavior (WITHOUT skill)
### Target Behavior (WITH skill)
### Pressure Variations
### Success Criteria        <- checkbox list, the pass/fail bar
## Scenario 2: ...
```

`plugins/code-intelligence/tests/baseline-scenarios.md` is the canonical
example - copy its shape.

**Every content PR must:**

1. First validate locally with the commands in
   [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#validation).
2. Run the scenarios per that file's `## Running These Tests`: capture each
   prompt's output with the plugin OFF (baseline), then ON (target).
3. Confirm every scenario meets its `### Success Criteria` and introduces no
   new rationalizations. A single failing scenario blocks the PR.
4. When a PR adds or changes a behavior, add or update a scenario so the
   behavior stays covered.
5. Paste the baseline and target transcripts into the PR template (or `/tmp`) -
   never commit them under `plugins/`.

## CI

`validate.yml` runs on relevant plugin content, marketplace manifests,
repository tooling/workflows, external-update policy, and contributor docs. It
checks tooling unit tests, frontmatter, size, **inline plugin tests present**
(baseline-scenarios.md with scenarios + run protocol + success criteria),
manifest validity, manifest <-> SKILL.md <-> `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
version sync, **POWER.md (Kiro) regenerated and in sync**, **three-manifest
external sync** (`.claude-plugin` <-> `.agents` <-> `.kiro`, including stale
mirror detection), broken links, and markdown lint.

Every step in **Validate Skill Files** is blocking - markdown lint included
(no `continue-on-error`). One red step fails the whole check.

Merge policy: **do not merge a PR with a red `Validate Skill Files`.** This is
enforced by policy and the visible failing check, not by a server-side merge
block - the per-plugin release pipeline pushes version bumps straight to
`master`, so a hard required-status-check on the branch would also block
releases. Treat a red check as a hard stop anyway; fix it before merge.
